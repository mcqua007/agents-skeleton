# General Coding Rules

<!-- This file is a pointer, not a copy. All shared conventions live in
     the root-level docs to keep things DRY across all agent tools. -->

Read and follow these shared documents:

- `AGENTS.md` — Project orientation, doc map, and agent behavior expectations.
- `CONVENTIONS.md` — Code style, naming, testing, commit messages, and documentation.
- `ARCHITECTURE.md` — Codemap, dependency directions, and architectural invariants.
- `.editorconfig` — Indent style/size, line endings, charset.

# Component Guidelines

<!-- This is an example of a glob-scoped Cursor rule.
     It only activates when working on files matching the glob pattern above.
     Customize the globs and content for your project's needs. -->

- Components should be self-contained with clear props interfaces.
- Prefer composition over inheritance.
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks or utility functions.
- Keep component files focused — one primary export per file.

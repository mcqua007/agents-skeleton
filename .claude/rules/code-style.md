# Code Style Rules

<!-- Uncomment and customize the paths frontmatter to scope these rules:
---
paths:
  - "src/**/*.ts"
  - "src/**/*.tsx"
---
-->

<!-- This file is a pointer, not a copy. All shared conventions live in
     CONVENTIONS.md to keep things DRY across all agent tools. -->

Read and follow:

- @CONVENTIONS.md — Code style, naming, imports, formatting, and commit standards.
- @.editorconfig — Indent style/size, line endings, charset.

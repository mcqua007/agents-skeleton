# Documentation Rules

<!-- This file is a pointer, not a copy. Documentation conventions live in
     CONVENTIONS.md to keep things DRY across all agent tools. -->

Read and follow the documentation section in:

- @CONVENTIONS.md — Doc update triggers, standards, and what belongs where.
- @AGENTS.md — Documentation map and agent behavior expectations.

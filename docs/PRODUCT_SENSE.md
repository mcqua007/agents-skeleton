# Product Sense

> Product principles, user empathy, and domain context.
> This file helps agents understand the "why" behind the "what."

## Who Are Our Users?

<!-- TODO: Define your user personas.
     Example:
     - **Developer**: Wants fast, reliable tooling with minimal configuration.
     - **Team Lead**: Needs visibility into progress and code quality.
     - **End User**: Wants a simple, intuitive interface that solves their problem.
-->

## Product Principles

<!-- TODO: Define 3-5 product principles.
     Example:
     1. **Speed over features** — A fast, simple tool beats a slow, feature-rich one.
     2. **Convention over configuration** — Sensible defaults that just work.
     3. **Transparency** — Users should always understand what's happening and why.
     4. **Graceful degradation** — The system should work partially, not fail completely.
-->

## Domain Context

<!-- TODO: Explain the business domain in plain language.
     An agent with no prior context should be able to understand the problem
     space from this section alone.
-->

## Key User Journeys

<!-- TODO: Document the critical paths users take through the product.
     Example:
     1. New user → Sign up → Complete onboarding → First value moment
     2. Returning user → Log in → Access dashboard → Take primary action
-->

## Success Metrics

<!-- TODO: What does success look like?
     Example:
     - Time to first value: < 5 minutes
     - Daily active usage retention: > 60%
     - Error rate: < 0.1%

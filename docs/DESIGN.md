# Design Conventions

> UI/UX design patterns, component conventions, and visual standards.

<!-- TODO: Customize for your project. -->

## Design Principles

- Consistency over novelty — reuse existing patterns before creating new ones.
- Accessibility first — all interactive elements must be keyboard-navigable
  and screen-reader compatible.
- Progressive disclosure — show only what's needed at each level; reveal
  complexity on demand.

## Component Patterns

<!-- TODO: Document your component library conventions.
     Example:
     - Button variants: primary, secondary, ghost, destructive
     - Form patterns: inline validation, error states, loading states
     - Layout patterns: page shells, sidebars, modals
-->

## Color & Typography

<!-- TODO: Reference your design system or define basics here. -->

## Responsive Breakpoints

<!-- TODO: Define breakpoints if applicable. -->

## Iconography

<!-- TODO: Icon library and usage conventions. -->

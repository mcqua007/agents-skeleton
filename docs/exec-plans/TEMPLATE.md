# Execution Plan Template

> Copy this template to `active/<plan-name>.md` when starting complex work.
> Move to `completed/` when finished. See the
> [OpenAI Exec Plans cookbook](https://cookbook.openai.com/articles/codex_exec_plans)
> for the full methodology.

## Plan: <!-- Title -->

**Created:** <!-- YYYY-MM-DD -->
**Author:** <!-- Name or agent ID -->
**Status:** `active` | `completed` | `blocked` | `abandoned`

### Objective

<!-- What are we trying to accomplish? 1-3 sentences. -->

### Context

<!-- Why is this work needed? What problem does it solve?
     Link to relevant design docs, specs, or issues. -->

### Approach

<!-- High-level strategy. How will we accomplish the objective? -->

### Progress

<!-- Timestamp each step as it's completed.
     This lets agents (and humans) measure velocity. -->

- [ ] <!-- Step 1 description --> `<!-- YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM -->`
- [ ] <!-- Step 2 description -->
- [ ] <!-- Step 3 description -->

### Surprises & Discoveries

<!-- Document anything unexpected found during execution.
     This is critical context for the Decision Log. -->

1. <!-- Surprise or discovery -->

### Decision Log

<!-- Record decisions made during execution with rationale.
     A novice should be able to understand why each choice was made. -->

| Date | Decision | Rationale | Alternatives Considered |
| ---- | -------- | --------- | ----------------------- |
|      |          |           |                         |

### Outcomes & Retrospective

<!-- Fill this in when moving the plan to `completed/`. -->

**Result:** <!-- Success / Partial / Failed -->

# Codex CLI — Project Configuration
# https://github.com/openai/codex
#
# This file provides project-scoped overrides for Codex CLI.
# Codex reads AGENTS.md natively as its instruction file.
# Precedence: CLI flags > project config > user config > system config.

# --- Model ---
# Uncomment to pin a specific model for this project:
# model = "o4-mini"

# --- Approval Policy ---
# Options: "suggest" | "auto-edit" | "full-auto"
# approval_policy = "suggest"

# --- Sandbox Policy ---
# Options: "strict" | "permissive"
# sandbox_policy = "strict"

# --- Project Doc ---
# Codex reads AGENTS.md by default. Add fallback filenames if needed:
# project_doc_fallback_filenames = ["TEAM_GUIDE.md"]
# project_doc_max_bytes = 32768
